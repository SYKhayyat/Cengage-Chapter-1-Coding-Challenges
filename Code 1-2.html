            We make ourselves a place apart <br>
            &nbsp; Behind light words that tease and flout, <br>
            But oh, the agitated heat <br>
            &nbsp;Till someone finds us really out. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            'Tis pity if the case require <br>
            &nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end <br>
            We speak the literal to inspire <br>
            &nbsp;The understanding of a friend. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But so with all, from babes that play <br>
            &nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar, <br>
            So all who hide too well away <br>
            &nbsp;Must speak and tell us where they are, <br>
        </p>
